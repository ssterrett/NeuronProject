## A Model of Norepinephrine Modulated Plasticity
In this project, we modified an existing model of calcium dependent plasticity dynamics to include dependence on Norepinephrine. 
The model followed from experimental evidence that NE acts on the same serines as those in Shouval's Calcium model. 
After modeling these synaptic changes, we studied how they manifested in the voltage at the soma when a current was applied to the dendrites. 
We found that our model closely followed the temporal and electrical profile of experimental slice data.

## Code 
* The main code deals with importing the morphological data contained in the mat files. 
* The multiple mat files contain the neuron morphology data.
